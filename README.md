# Ember-cli-static-site

An addon for building static sites using Ember CLI and FastBoot.


`ember install ember-cli-static-site`

This addon currently requires ember-cli-fastboot to also be installed as a dependency to your ember-cli application.

`ember install ember-cli-fastboot`

This addon has been tested with Ember CLI 2.6.1.

## Examples
- [robwebdev/fastboot-website](https://github.com/robwebdev/fastboot-website) - A fork of the FastBoot website, [converted to a static site](https://github.com/robwebdev/fastboot-website/commit/ce3bca25a980b9a668aeb32aef01e44bcf5c8e23) using ember-cli-static-site.
- [ember-cli-static-site-website](https://github.com/robwebdev/ember-cli-static-site-website) - The source for [ember-cli-static-site.com](http://www.ember-cli-static-com)

## Configuration
You need to tell the addon which routes to hit when the static site is generated. This is done by passing a `ember-cli-static-site` config object to `ember-cli-build.js`. For example:

```js
  var app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
    'ember-cli-static-site': {
      paths: [
        '/',
        '/posts',
        '/posts/1',
        '/posts/2'
      ]
    }
  });
```

`vendor.js` and `app.js` are not included in the generated pages therefore **the Ember app will not boot on the client**.

## `link-to`
Use `link-to` helpers as you would normally. The `href` attribute will be modified with a path to a static page.

## `build` and `serve`
Use `ember build` and `ember serve` as you would normally. The static pages will be output to the dist path like a regular build.
